# Space-Invaders

The game has been implemented using the SGG library, developed by the professor of AUEB CPP Programming course and his team. For more information about that library check its [github repository](https://github.com/cgaueb/sgg). It contains a nice documentation and many useful informations about how to use the library to create a simple game. 

In /sgg you can find the files that we used from the sgg library.

In /src you can find our code developed using Microsoft Visual Studio. We have also uploaded the .dll files in /bin where you can find the .exe file to download and play our game so you dont need to build our project in VS from scratch.

In the bin/assets you can find the sounds, music and pictures that we used to create the "Star Wars" version of Space Invaders. You can change those assets by loading yours in the specific folder. If you decide not to keep the existing names for the files you should go to the code and change the assets names in each class constructor too.
